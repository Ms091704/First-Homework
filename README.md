# Getting started with github and answering pendulum questions 

### [what is a pendulum?](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pendulum)
## How do you expect the rigid pendulum will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency $\omega = \sqrt{g/L}$ of the pendulum (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?
The pedulum will exibit a _small amplitude of oscillation_ as there will be a minimal responce. 

## If the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?
The pendulum will swing farther than its equillibrium position due to the sudden change in the pivots position that will in turn **increase** its swing.

## If we start the pendulum oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior? 
* continue to fall exhibiting a more rapid fall than if it remained stationary 
* cause the pendulum to have a larger swing 
* have a faster descent
